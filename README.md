# personal-finance-tracker

This is a Python tool I built to track expenses and income. It works with simple text commands—no complex menus, just type and go.

### What it does
- **Text-based Interface:** You interact with the program by typing your data directly into the command line.
- **Data Logging:** Add your daily spendings or earnings easily.
- **Automatic Charts:** Even though you enter data as text, it pops up visual charts at the end to show your progress.


### Built with
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (to save and load data)
- **Matplotlib** (to create the graphs)

### How to use it
1. Open your command prompt or power shell.
2. Install the libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib`.
3. Run the script: `python main.py`.
4. Follow the prompts to enter your data.
